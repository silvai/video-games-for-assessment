** Install Guide **
* Pre-requisites: what is the required configuration of software and hardware that the customer must have before they can begin the installation process?
Build instructions (if needed): if you are providing the raw source code rather than a binary build, how will the customer and users create the required executable application?
    - In order to play our game you must have access to a computer that can run MacOS or Linux. 
    - The build file is available here on github and can be downloaded as a game file to play.
    - We are currently in the process of creating a more user friendly installer that will allow the user to simply click the game icon and play.

* Dependent libraries that must be installed: what third party software must be installed for your software to function?
    - No libraries are necessary. They will all be included within the build file.
    
* Download instructions: how will the customer and users get access to the project?
    - The build file is currently available on github

Run instructions:  what does the user/customer have to do to get the software to execute?
Troubleshooting:  what are common errors that occur during installation and what is the corrective action?
