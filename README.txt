**Install Guide**
* Pre-requisites: what is the required configuration of software and hardware that the customer must have before they can begin the installation process?
    In order to play our game you must have access to a computer that can run MacOS or Linux. The build file is available here on github 

* Dependent libraries that must be installed: what third party software must be installed for your software to function?
    No libraries are necessary. They will all be included within the build file.
    
* Download instructions: how will the customer and users get access to the project?

Build instructions (if needed): if you are providing the raw source code rather than a binary build, how will the customer and users create the required executable application?

Installation of actual application: what steps have to be taken after the software is built? What directories are required for installation?

Run instructions:  what does the user/customer have to do to get the software to execute?

Troubleshooting:  what are common errors that occur during installation and what is the corrective action?
